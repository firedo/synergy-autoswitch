Synergy version 1.X Autoswitcher (between client and server mode) &amp; start at login window (GDM3 greeter)

I'm sharing my Bash script and autostart desktop files for starting Synergy v.1 in client/server mode (using autoswitch and loop). Includes as well a short guide to enable Synergy version 1.X @ Ubuntu 18.04 login window (GDM3 greeter).
